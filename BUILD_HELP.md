# Building This Mod - Network Issue Workaround

Your network cannot reach Mojang's servers, but here are solutions:

## Option 1: Build on Another Computer/Network
1. Copy this entire mod folder to another computer with working internet
2. Run `gradlew.bat build` there
3. Copy the built `.jar` file from `build/libs/` back to your computer

## Option 2: Use Mobile Hotspot (Different ISP)
1. Connect your computer to your phone's mobile hotspot
2. Make sure it's a different carrier/ISP than your current network
3. Run `gradlew.bat build`

## Option 3: Get Dependencies Manually
If you can find these files, we can place them manually:
- Minecraft 1.21.5 client jar
- Version manifest JSON
- Yarn mappings for 1.21.5

## Option 4: Ask Someone to Build It
Share this mod folder with someone who has working internet, have them build it, and they can send you the `.jar` file.

## Option 5: Use VPN Service
Try a free VPN service like:
- ProtonVPN (free tier)
- Windscribe (free tier)
- TunnelBear (limited free data)

## Current Status
- ✅ All mod code is complete and ready
- ✅ Configuration files are correct for Minecraft 1.21.5
- ❌ Cannot download Minecraft dependencies due to network/firewall issue

Once the dependencies are downloaded (even just once), Gradle will cache them and future builds will work even offline.
